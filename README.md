# R.E.T.I.N.A.
Real-time Electronic Threat &amp; Intrusion Neutralization Apparatus

RETINA is the very first Retro Videogame built for Reverse Engineers. Do you want to start the analysis of that sample, but are are not really in the mood? You can try RETINA for Commodore 64, which can be fully customized with your own sample so that during your game you will perform also the Malware Triage!

The basic idea behind it is that you can get any Malware sample, get it analyzed on a modern system and then create a custom version of the game that will contain the information extracted from the malware itself.
The analysis process relies on the well known `CAPA` tool (by Mandiant) which produce a Triage with the capabilities of an executable. The result will be merged and complied in a custom game that you can play on your real Commodore 64 (or on an emulator obviousy).
You can play it with keyboard, joystick or even paddles (I built one for this) for more fun!
